### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2 was one of my favorite projects that I have had to complete.
    It was one of the first instances where we had to use nested loops. The
    main idea of the lab was making a pattern out of symbols like several
    asterisks and bars, it wasn't very complex but it required me to think
    about how I approached the problem to achieve the result. A lot of the labs
    that were dealt with this year were made up of just following a lot of TODO
    statements without having to think for myself on how to solve the issue at
    hand, but Lab 8, part 2 was different and we had to come up with a solution
    ourselves without relying on the answer that the directions often gave us.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 seemed like the ordinary lab assignment that would be given
    to a student to complete, but in my case, I had an issue with it where the
    Linux laptop itself was having an error from trying to turn the 'string'
    into an integer when it wasn't possible. This error was expected for it
    to not work; however, the issue was that since the terminal itself was not
    allowing the process to run, it was causing me to fail one of the unit
    tests on the lab. For me to fix this error, I ended up doing some personal
    research into a coding statement that we hadn't necessarily learned yet: a
    try-catch statement, which attempts to run a section of code, and if it
    failed (like mine was), it would 'catch' the error. Instead of abruptly
    ending the program, it would take a different route in the code so that the
    code can keep running. Unfortunately, I was told to remove this from my
    code as we hadn't necessarily learned that in class but it was nice to be
    discover a concept on my own and apply it to what I needed to complete in
    class.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10 was one of the unique labs that we had where we only dealt with one
    part rather than the two-part labs that we were often given. It was an
    interesting lab that dealt with 2D vectors, creating a full table of
    counties with information on each one and we were instructed to develop a
    program that would calculate the population, land area, population density,
    and a few more things. It was interesting to work with 2D vectors and this
    lab helped clear up the concept of 2D vectors, which was strange to me
    initially. Learning how to deal with 2D vectors was an essential skill that
    we used in later labs and so finally understanding the concept through this
    lab was incredibly satisfying compared to previous labs that I was assigned.
